Advanced Arithmetic Calculator - Project 2
----

**Description**

---

The Advanced Arithmetic Calculator is a GUI-based calculator built using the TK package for Python. 
It implementes arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and power functions. It performs basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced calculations such as finding squares and even numbers. Moreover, it evaluates arithmetic expressions with proper operator precedence.
This project also integrates file functions that allow saving results to a file for further use.
This project was developed by Dieynabou Diallo, Jana Abedeljaber, Noelle Marcy, Yutong Ye.

**Features**

---

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Advanced Functions:
Calculate squares of numbers.
Calculate logarithm of a number with specified base.
Calculate the mean of a dataset.
Calculate the largest number from a set of numbers.
List even numbers within a given range.
Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the TK package for ease of use.
File Functions: Save and load results to/from text files for squares and even numbers. Save results from fibonacci sequence.
Check if a given number is a prime number. 
Return the minimum from a set of numbers. 
Generate odd numbers in a given range and then print them in a specific file.
Find the mode of a dataset.

**File Operations**

---
Our calculator offers the ability to save results to files and load data from files. 
This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or when you want to store the results of square or even calculations for later use.

Saving Results: The results for square calculations, even numbers, odd numbers, and fibonacci sequence up to a limit can be saved to a text file.
Loading Results: You can load previous calculations from a file.

**How to Run File**

---
Type ruby Calculator_gui.rb into your terminal and the application should appear.
